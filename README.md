# How to Build
 Create an environment variable on your operating system called `outreach_maps_key`. The value for the key will be the Google Maps API token which will be provided to you prior to the interview.

 Simply clone the repo and navigate within the `candidate-questions` and execute the following command:

 `mvn clean install`

 # Purpose

 The purpose of this repo is to provide students with a sample project that they can then use in order to interact with Google Maps.

 In order to create an API key log in with `Patrique's` GMAIL profile and create a new API key. 

 The URL to do so is here: `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=outreach-v2-1528904629755&authuser=0`

 # How to Test

 Simply clone the repo and navigate within the `candidate-questions` and execute the following command:
